            <h3>SlickZilla E-Barber Website</h3>
            <img src="project2.jpg" alt="Project 2"><img src="project23.jpg" alt="Project 23"><img src="project22.jpg" alt="Project 22">
            <p>Slickzilla E-Barber is an e-barber booking system specifically made to ensure customers who want to make 
                appointment at the barber shop through online means. I come up with this idea during lock down when 
                I want to have a haircut, but the barber always full whenever I want to have a service. I 
                realized not only me, but other people experience the same problem.</p>
            <p>Therefore, I create SlickZilla E-Barber. This system has been developed so that customer will be able to arrange an appointment through my online web or the application which will provide the same services as Booksy, Book Me Barber and theCut but specifically made for customers in UITM Kedah and the main place is Malinja college . Furthermore, I aimed to attract more customer with the easier way for customer to have their haircut done with just one click away.</p>
            <p>For this project, I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and also MySQL for its database.</p>

            <h3>3D Car Model</h3>
            <img src="project3.jpg" alt="Project 3">
            <img src="project32.jpg" alt="Project 32">
            <p>The Ford Mustang is a series of American automobiles manufactured by Ford. In continuous production since 1964, the Mustang is currently the longest-produced Ford car nameplate. Currently in its seventh generation, it is the fifth-best selling Ford car nameplate. The namesake of the "pony car" automobile segment, the Mustang was developed as a highly styled line of sporty coupes and convertibles derived from existing model lines, initially distinguished by "long hood, short deck" proportions. I chose this model for my 3D modeling project not only because of its cutting-edge technology but also because of its aesthetic design, which combines aggressive, muscular styling with refined, aerodynamic details. The sharp lines, distinctive front grille, and sleek profile have always captivated me, evoking a sense of speed and power even when standing still. My enduring admiration for the Ford Mustang since childhood, sparked by its appearances in video games, movies, and car shows, has fueled my passion for automotive design. This personal connection to the Ford Mustang's iconic look and high-performance legacy makes it an inspiring and meaningful subject for my project in Blender, allowing me to know the intricate details and celebrate a car that has been a longtime favorite of mine.</p>
